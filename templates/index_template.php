      <div class="well">
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Introduction</span><br><span style="margin-left: 20px;">The <a href="https://digital.ag.iastate.edu/" target="mbdh">Digital Agriculture Spoke</a> of the 
			<a href="http://midwestbigdatahub.org/" target="mbdh">Midwest Big Data Hub</a> seeks to organize academic, industrial, and governmental 
			sectors around the development of policies and best practices for data science and Big Data applications in 
			agriculture, with a particular focus on automating the Big Data lifecycle for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and for 
			plant sciences, phenomics, and genomics.</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Revolutions</span><br><span style="margin-left: 20px;">Historically, agricultural revolutions in cultivation, social 
			organization, and industrialization have provided the means to increase food production. However, future 
			revolutions must leverage the advantages provided by the modern information society. The 
			<span style='font-weight: bold;'>UASPSE</span> project will serve as a catalyst for this data-driven revolution, which will be broad and 
			societal in nature and address the triple-bottom line of being economically viable, socially acceptable, and 
			environmentally sensible. Whereas the initial focus areas are specific, the resulting best practices and partnership-building 
			will translate to and enable other areas such as remote sensing systems and farm management techniques.</span></p>
		<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Outcomes</span><br><span style="margin-left: 20px;">An expected outcome 
			is improved and efficient use of UAS, imaging, and genomics in agricultural sciences, ultimately leading to a more sustainable 
			global food and nutrition system. Coordination of these activities will be enhanced through this Digital Agriculture open web 
			portal of data science resources, designed to integrate existing information silos, facilitate collaboration, 
			and contribute to workforce development. Educational activities and tools will be leveraged from pre-existing traineeship 
			programs and collaborative entities, and broadened with newly developed annual workshops. Special issue-teams of academic, 
			industrial, and governmental representatives will be used to conduct deep-learning analysis of project educational activities 
			to identify and refine mechanisms for broadening and diversifying participation.</span></p>
		<p><span style="margin-left: 20px;">Through these efforts, the collaboration will improve access to data assets, 
			train a workforce with relevant skills and expertise, and will contribute to solving the Sustainable Global Food and 
			Nutrition Security challenge.</span></p>
